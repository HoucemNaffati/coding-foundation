- Variable names: variables can have any name you want (as long as they start
with a letter, and don't have crazy characters), the reason why we try to name
them well is because we are not only writing the program for the computer to
read but mostly for other humans to read.

- import: import is a keyword in python that gets information from an external
library, basically this means getting extra things we need to use in our
program rather than writing ourselves, programmers are LAZY and that's good.

Examples:

    import random   # So we can get random functions that give us random things
    import datetime # So we can use date operations, like getting the date now
