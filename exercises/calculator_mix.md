# Calculator Mix

- Try to do the calculator you did some time ago.
- Here is the gist of it: Ask the user for two numbers, then an operation, and then show them the result.

Now do this using:
- One big blob of code (this was the first time you did this exercise)
- Using functions (doesn't matter where, see where they are more useful)
- Using classes
