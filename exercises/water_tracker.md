# Water Tracker

## Part 1

Build a water tracker that tracks how much water you drink and tells you how
many cups of water you drank during the day and when.

It's a program that's running "forever" and will ask you to write when you
drink a cup of water.


## Part 2

Using Files, make the water tracker store in a file the "tracks" and reads from
that same time when you "check"


## Part 3

Create a `class` that will track the water for you and check how much water you
drank.

The goal is to have the class do all the heavy work for you.

Hint: You just need to move the code you already have, to a class
